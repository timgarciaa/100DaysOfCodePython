# Instructions
# I was reading this article by Tim Urban - Your Life in Weeks and realised just how little time we actually have.

# https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html

# Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.

# It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:

# You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.

# Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.

# Warning your output should match the Example Output format exactly, even the positions of the commas and full stops.

# Example Input
# 56
# Example Output
# You have 12410 days, 1768 weeks, and 408 months left.
# e.g. When you hit run, this is what should happen:



# Hint
# There are 365 days in a year, 52 weeks in a year and 12 months in a year.
# Try copying the example output into your code and replacing the relevant parts so that the sentence is formated the same way.

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
age = input("What is your current age? ")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
years = 90 - int(age)
print(f"You have {years * 365} days, {years * 52} weeks, and {years * 12} months left.")
